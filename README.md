#IMC coding assignment.

##Overview
This solution represents classic paper-rock-scissors for two people with possible scalability. 
By input from console, user can choice what symbol to display: P - paper, R - rock, S - scissors   

##Technology and structure overview 
In this assignment I used Guice: a lightweight DI framework from google. 

Starting class is com.imc.kabanov.PaperRockScissorGameStarter that combines required game configurations, 
binds all dependencies and start PaperRockScissorGame that represents a series of N PaperRockScissor games.
Number of games "N" is configured in game.properties in resources.
 
###Packages:
####Configuration
All configurations are located in package "configuration".
 - ConsoleInputOutputModule - configures all input and output goes to console
 - GamePropertiesModule - configures the loading of game properties from resources
 - TwoPlayersGameModule - configures game and strategy for two players
 - PlayerComputerModule - configures one player to be a human and another - a computer 

####Data
Contains data game objects

####Game
Contains logic for a Human and Computer. Additionally it has the logic of the single game for two players 

####IO
Contains abstractions for input/output operations, and implementation of console IO operations. 
Class GameEventNotificator contains all the actions that should be displayed in UI, what allows to 
easily test what going to be shown in UI

####Strategy 
Contains the strategy of calculating the winner from several game symbols.

####Validation
Contains methods to validate game parameters 

 
##How to run 
Game can be started with a single command: gradlew runApplication -q --console=plain
flags: "-q --console=plain" hides gradle build status from console that interferes with user input
